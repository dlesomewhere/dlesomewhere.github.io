  alt: Sybil and Dave on the phone. Hold please.
items:
  - question: When should I RSVP by?
    answer: End of March please!
  - question: How do I get there?
    answer: There’s a big car park at Whitekirk Hill if you’re driving - otherwise get a train or bus to North Berwick, then taxi or the 120 bus (please note this is quite sporadic!) up to Whitekirk Hill.
  - question: Are kids welcome?
    answer: Yes, as long as they belong to you! The site is very family friendly, just let us know if you’re bringing your children and how many so we can feed them.
  - question: Aah what should I WEAR?
    answer: You do you! Dresses, suits, kilts, jeans, fancy dress - all welcome! Please bear in mind we have a rock ceilidh band and there might be rounders (both optional!) so wear or bring vaguely comfy shoes if you want to partake in either of those!
  - question: Do you have a gift list?
    answer: Nope! We just want the delight of your company - no gifts required. We have a fairly small flat and Sybil has mild hoarding tendencies so please don’t give us more things! If you’re absolutely desperate to give a gift, a small donation to our honeymoon would be lovely, but in no way expected or required!
  - question: How do I get home?
    answer: There are a few hotels in nearby North Berwick - although these do tend to fill up early so do book in plenty of time!
